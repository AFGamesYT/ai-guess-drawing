# Ai Guess Drawing Game

## Description
*A game heavily inspired by Quick, Draw! (https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/)*

- You get 20 seconds to draw an image on a 28x28 canvas, and an AI attempts to guess the drawing every second.
- After the round, you get to train the AI on the image that you drew.

## How do I play?

- Launch *main.py* with python.
  
- Some things will appear in the console, not only debugging.
- All of your drawings will be saved to *drawings/____*
- I have provided at least 10 drawings in each class.
- **Make sure that all of the folders are in place!**

## Warnings

The program is buggy, the buttons sometimes don't get pressed, it freezes because the AI is learning.
The AI is **not** smart, and it **will not** guess your drawing, unless you play the game for a while, and train the AI enough.
